Though, I admit, this is all Narwhal's and Rivados' fault. When Shark had come here with his crew, he wanted to establish a base, but our people and Rivados really disliked the idea. They attacked Shark's brig at night and set it on fire\nThey better didn't! Shark's crew is full of devils not men, yes. First, they destroyed hostile boats, then landed and started a real slaughter. Narwhals retreated and Rivados run away as fast as they could. Finally, pirates captured San Augustine where the most of Island's provision supplies are held, then they took Tartarus\nShark imprisoned our leader Alan Milrow, who also was my... my close friend, and Rivados wizard Chimiset. He sent them to rot in Tartarus's cages like beasts. It's easy to swim to Tartarus from here and I managed to visit Alan a few times. There I met Chad Kapper, Shark made him a jailer. I asked Chad to release Alan, promised him money, but he was afraid to confront admiral\nAnd then Alan was murdered right in the prison. Chad told me that Shark did this, yes. So I went to Donald, who was elected as a leader in place of Alan, and demanded from him to attack the pirates immediately, yet he refused, said that those sea devils are too tough for us. That was when I told him to fuck himself\nMy people were worthless in this matter, so I made a deal with Kapper, the scum wanted to take Shark's place. We had a plan - to lure admiral from his fortress to some shady place and kill him there. We also found a sniper with a good rifle, he could shoot admiral from the Fury's mast\nNow the interesting part comes, the day before yesterday I visited Tartarus at night, wanted to say something important to Chad concerning our plan. Swam to the boat and accidentally overheard Chad talking with two Narwhals. Turned out that Shark didn't kill Alan. Chad did and then secretly spread gossips about admiral's involvement\nHe murdered him because of me. First, he wanted to make me his plaything in a bed.
